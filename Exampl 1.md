### C7H14O

### __IR spectrum__

![hello](https://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?Spec=C123193&Index=1&Type=IR)

As denoted in the earlier page there are certain characteristics that allow 
the analysis of IR spectra.

In the IR spectra there are peaks at:
* 3000cm^-1 
* 1713 cm^-1

The peak at 3000 cm^-1 suggests at __sp3 C__
.The peak at 1713cm-1 suggests a __carbonyl (C=O)__, this peak is in the region where ketones appear,
this suggests  that we are dealing with a __ketone__ or __aldehyde__.

### What are the possible structures?

After identifying the key IR peaks we can see that a carbonyl is present.
you can confirm that this molecule is indeed a __ketone__! If the molecule was an aldehyde a H-C=O peak would appear in the 
2830-2695 region. 

Now that the functional group has been confirmed you can draw the possible structures based on the empirical formula given.

### NMR
Using the structures you have proposed, you can begin characterising the peaks that you are expecting.
For example if you have 2 possible structures: 4-heptanone and 3-heptanone you can guess that 4-heptanone, 
will have 3 peaks due to its symetry, whereas 3-heptanone will have 6 peaks as all the protons are in different 
environments.

* Set 1: Chemical shift(0.93), triplet, integration 6.
* Set 2: Chemical shift (1.60), hextet, integration 4.
* Set 3: Chemical shift (2.40), triplet, integration 4.

As you can see the NMR has 3 visible peaks:

The first set of protons are extremely up field which tells you that there are no highly electronegative 
atoms near it. It is also split into a triplet which indicates a bonded C-H2.

The second set is split into a sextet which tells you that it's being split by 5 other protons,
this could suggest that it's being split by a C-H3 and C-H2 group. 

The final set is more downfield than the other two protons, telling you that it's near an electronegative atom such as Oxygen.
This is split into a triplet suggesting it is near a C-H2 group. 

With all this information you can make an educated attempt at producing the structure of the molecule. 
Taking into account that there are 3 peaks instead of 6 tells you that there is symetry in the molecule, this can help you 
to work out the correct structure which is:
