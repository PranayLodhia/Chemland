# IR spectroscopy and NMR ( The basics!!) 
This part of the module is split into three parts:

* IR
* NMR Spectroscopy

## IR spectroscopy
IR spectroscopy measures the __absorbance__ of infrared radiation which matches a __vibrational translation__ of specific functional groups.
As with all things in Chemistry there are selection rules and these are:
* There must be __vibration__ which equal an __oscillating electric dipole moment__. 
The IR active bond stretches 
* __Heteronuclear__ diatomic molecules.
The IR inactive bond stretches 
* __Homonuclear__ diatomic vibrations
__Polyatomic__ can be both inactive and active.
* Symmetrical = __inactive__
* Bending = __active__
* Asymmetrical = __active__
                    
### Common peaks
* Alkene C=C (weak - mid) signal - 1700-1600cm^-1
* Carbonyl C=O (strong) - 1850-1650cm^-1
* Alkyne C-C (weak - mid) - 2300-2100cm^-1
* Alkane sp3-C (strong) - 2900cm^-1
* Alkene sp2-C (weak - mid) - 3100cm^-1
* Alkyne sp-C (strong) - 3300cm^-1
* H-bonded O-H (broad) - 3500-3000cm^-1
* Free O-H (Sharp) - 3600cm^-1

Below is a diagram that shows the stretching frequencies of IR spectroscopy.

# NMR 
NMR is one of  the most powerful analytical tools chemists can use.
It is a non-destructive and information rich technique.

Peaks will appear at different chemical shifts, these  are affected by electronegative elements such as oxygen. This will deshield the proton pushing it downfield.


Below is a diagram that shows the chemical shift and splitting patterns in H NMR:
