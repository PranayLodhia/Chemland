Here is 4-hydroxypentanoic acid, as you can see there is no symetry which means that all protons are in different environments.
(As second years you __DO NOT__ need to know this but proton B is bonded to a chiral centre, this means that the protons
on D are diastereotopic)

Going through this from A-F:

* A will be split into a doublet, with intensity 1:1
* B will be split by protons on A(3H),C(1H) and D(2H). It will be split into a septet with intensity of
1:6:15:20:15:6:1
* C will be split by proton B into a doublet with intensity 1:1, with respect to chemical shift we can expect this proton to be 
extremely downfield , as it is bonded to a highly electronegative oxygen. 
* D will be split into a quartet with a splitting pattern of 1:3:3:1. It is split by protons on B and E.
* E will be split into a triplet by the protons on D with an intensity is 1:3:1. 
* F will be left as a singlet as there are no protons within 3 bond lengths of it. this will also have a highly downfield  
chemical shift due to the electronegative oxygen.
