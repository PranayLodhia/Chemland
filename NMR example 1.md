# NMR analysis (easy)

This section will look at spotting proton environment and assigning protons to spectra. 
We will start of with easier molecules and work our way to harder more complicated systems. 

### Pentane

In the example above we can see that pentane has a line of symmetry through the middle. This symmetry places both terminal carbons in the same environment (labeled A),
.The hydrogens bonded to the beta-carbon (labeled B) are in another environment and the protons bound to the central carbon are in a third environment (labeled C). 
This means that there are three separate carbon environment within this molecule. The protons that are in the same environment are 
said to be __equivalent__

## So what would the NMR look like? 

Working A-C, we can see that:

* A is next to two protons, this will split A into a __triplet__ with an intensity of 1:3:1

* B is in the middle of two proton environments, one with three protons, and another with two protons. Using the 
n+1 rule we would see a signal with six lines ( a sextet, with intensity 1:5:10:10:5:1).

* C is in the middle of the molecule, even though it is next to two carbons with two protons attached,
they are equivalent they do not split the C protons four times, but instead only twice. 

The NMR below is extremely difficult to read as the protons will have very similar shifts.

The NMR you would expect to see on the other hand is:
