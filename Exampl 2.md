### IR spectrum

This spectrum there are 2 peaks:

* 2977cm^-1
* 1740cm^-1
* 1368cm^-1 

The strong peak at 2977cm^-1 suggests a __sp3 C__. The sharp peak at 
1740cm^-1 indicates a __carbonyl C=O__ group. Unlike the other example 
the peak is at a higher wave number, the region for esters to appear is between 1760 - 1665cm^-1,
this peak of 1740cm^-1 is in that range, therefore you can begin thinking of ester structures that match teh empirical formula given.
There is also a peak at 1368cm^-1 which is indicative of a __C-O__ stretch, once again reinforcing an ester structure.

## What are the possible structures?

Esters have a functional group of R-O-(C=O). Using the empirical formula you can start drawing structures that may match.

## NMR analysis 
Using the structures you have proposed you can use the NMR to confirm if any of your structures are correct.
As you can see all the structures above have 5 separate proton environment, apart from methyl 3-methylbutanoate which has 4
proton environments.

(working right to left)

* Set 1: Chemical shift(0.94), doublet, integration 6.
* Set 2: Chemical shift(2.17), doublet, integration 2.
* Set 3: Chemical shift(2.40), sextet, integration 1.
* Set 4: Chemical shift(3.60), singlet, integration 1. 


As you can see there are 4 visible  peaks:

Set 1 is extremely down-field which suggests that the protons in this environment are extremely shielded and therefore up-field
. Set 1 is also split into doublets meaning they must be split by a single proton (C-H)

Set 2 has been split into a doublet which tells you that it also must be near a single proton.(C-H).

Set3 has been split into sextet, this tells you that there are 6 protons splitting this proton. It could be being split by 
two (C-H3) groups. 

set 4 is extremely down-field suggesting that it is near an electronegative elements. The proton has not been split giving a singlet
this tells you that there are no other protons in this environment. 

### Results

With the use of the NMR and IR we can see that there is only 1 structure that has 4 proton peaks. methyl 3-methylbutanoate.
Both the terminal CH3 are in the same environment, they will only appear as one peak. This is proved by the heptet
as it needed to be next to six protons.
