# Aromatics

The stretching frequency for aromatics is generally between __3100 - 3000cm^1__, this is only slightly higher than the C-H stretch in alkenes.
This is an extremely useful tool to differentiate between the two functional groups! The only stretching frequencies that are close to the alkane region are the alkenes and aromatic C-H stretching frequencies .
Other than these there are two  other distinctive IR characteristics:

* There are __small/weak overtones at 2000-1660cm^1__ 


* Secondly there may be stretches between __2000-1600cm^1__ indicating C - C bonds that are in an aromatic system.
 

The IR below is for 1,2,3-trimethlybenzene

A quick trick you may find useful is that aromatic compounds have loads of peaks. so if you are given 2 spectra and one had more peaks
it is most likely an aromatic compound!!
