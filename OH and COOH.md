# Alcohols and Carboxylic acids

## Alcohols

### Methanol 

Alcohols are one of the easiest functional groups to spot in IRs.
An alcohol will have a __broad stretch from 3500 - 3200cm^-1__
, this is extremely easy to spot.

There are also peaks that appear at __1260 - 3200cm^-1__ these indicate __C-O__ stretches.

## Carboxylic acids

### Pentanoic acid


Like alcohols, carboxylic acids will have an __OH stretch between 3500 - 3200cm^-1__ .
In addition, they will have a __sharp C=O peak between 1760 - 1690cm^-1__, it will also have a stretch at __1300-1200cm^-1 indicating a C-O__ group
