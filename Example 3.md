### IR analysis

In this spectrum there are 2 main peaks:

* Board peak at 3350cm^-1
* 2945cm^-1

The broad peak at 3350cm^-1 tells you that there is a  __H bonded OH__ in the molecule.
The width of the peak is significant to identify if there is hydrogen bonding present. If the 
OH was free you would see a sharp peak at 3600cm^-1.
The second peak at 2945cm^-1 tells you there is a __sp3 C__. 

## What are the possible structures?

From the information given you can assume that there may be two __OH__ groups as the empirical formula
is C3H8O2. The IR does not show any other functional group so the assumption of a diol is valid.

From this you can draw possible structures.

## NMR analysis

From the structures above you can see that two of the structures have symmetry. The first structure has 3 proton environments 
therefore you would expect three peaks. The second structure also has symmetry but will only have 2 peaks as there are only 
two sets of protons. The third structure has four proton environments, the two __OH__s are in the same environment,
you will see one peak for these protons.

(working from right to left)

* Set 1: Chemical shift(1.80), pentet
* set 2: Chemical shift(3.69), triplet
* set 3: Chemical shift(4.7), singlet

As you can see there are three visible  peaks:

Set 1 has been split into a pentet which indicates that this proton vicinal couples to the adjacent protons.  

Set 2 has been split into a triplet indicating splitting by 2 protons, __C-H2__ .

Set 3 is a singlet, this indicates it is far from any other protons. The Peak is also extremely down field, and therefore directly bonded 
to an electronegative atom. 

## Results

With all the information that has been given you can work out what the correct structure is 1,3-propandiol. The NMR shows 3 separate 
peaks which tells you that you have 3 proton environments, this structure is the only one that matches all the information given.
