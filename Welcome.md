# WELCOME

Welcome to my BSc practical project.

The overall focus of this project is to build and design a platform for undergraduate revision. I have chosen to focus on 
the module CH2200 " Spectroscopy theory and practice". I have spent 2 months building a dashboard which can be edited to allow 
all modules to use this tool to help undergraduate chemists with revision. 

In this dashboard you will find 4 main headings:

* Spectroscopy practice  - This contains information on how to read NMR data, and how to interpret NMRs through examples.


* Practice Problems - Here you find questions that you can try, ranging in difficulty. After submitting your answers you will
be given feedback on how you did and where you can do better


* Spectroscopy theory - Here I have built a dungeons and dragons based text adventure game. As you progress., the questions increases in difficulty. Also in this section i have made flash cards, 
as well as a Google forms quiz 


* 3D visualisations and point groups - In this section you will be able to use 3D visualisation  to 
help you answer questions regarding point groups and symetry axis.
