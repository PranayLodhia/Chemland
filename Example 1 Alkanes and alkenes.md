# Alkanes, Alkenes, Alkynes and Akyl halides.

On this page we will see the key characteristics that will help you identify __Alkene__, __Alkane__,__Alkyne__ and __Alkyl halides__ streching 
bands.

## Alkanes

### Pentane

The main way to identify alkanes is via the stretching frequency between 
3000-2850 cm^-1. This is a sp3 CH stretch.
Other Stretching frequencies are seen that are indicative of simple alkanes, however 
these are situated within the __fingerprint region__ 



The IR below is for __Pentane__:

The stretch at roughly 1500cm^-1 here represents the C-H bonds vibrating in a scissoring motion.

The stretch at roughly 1380cm^-1 represents the C-H bonds in a rocking motion.


## Alkenes


### Pentene

The main difference between pentane and pentene is the existence of a 
__sp2 C-H__ stretching frequency. this appears at __3100cm^-1__.

It is very hard to see at first but the circled area at 3100cm^-1 is the __sp2 C-H__ stretch.

Both Pentane and Pentene IRs look extremely similar, they are the same except for the sp2 C-H stretch from the H2C=CH2.


## Alkynes


### Pentyne

Alkynes are characterised by __C(triple bond)C__ bonds. These appear as strong sharp stretches at roughly __3300cm^-1__.
The peak at â‰ˆ2100cm^-1 confirms that there is a __C triple bond)C__ bond.

## Alkyl halides

### Bromopentane

Generally the C-X bond stretching frequency resides between __850 - 515 cm^-1__ and the 
 __C-H2(x)__ bond appears as a weak stretch at roughly __1300 - 1150 cm^-1__.
You can see that the spectra looks extremely similar to pentane, however the stretch at roughly 600cm^-1 indicates the
presence of a __halide__
