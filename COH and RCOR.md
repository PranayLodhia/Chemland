# Aldehydes and ketones

## Aldehydes

### Pentanal

The main stretch to look for in an aldehyde is the __aliphatic C=O, which appears around 1740-1720cm-1__.

Another hint to make life easier is that if you think you have an aldehyde look for a __little peak around 2720cm-1__ , it tends
to be located on the shoulder of the alkyl C-H peak.

## Ketones

### Pentanone

Ketones are very similar to aldehydes however the main difference is that the __C=O peak appears at 
1715cm^-1__. This is the only peak that is a characteristic of ketones.
